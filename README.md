## Usage

Once navigating the deployed url, users can click on the door to enter the store. After creating an account or logging in, users can create their own wand by selecting a wand style, color, core, length, and flexibility. After clicking the "Is this your wand?" button, users will either receive a message that the wand did not choose them and to try again, or will be directed to Stripe where they can buy their wand.
